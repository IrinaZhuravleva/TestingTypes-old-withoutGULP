          <p>Component testing is usually performed by the developer who wrote the code, but it at least requires access to the code being tested.</p>
          <p>TDD or Test driven development is highly iterative and is based on cycles of developing automated test cases, then building and integrating small pieces of code, then executing the component tests, correcting any issues, and re-factoring the code. </p>

          <h3>Specific approaches and responsibilities</h3>
          <p>Functional, non-functional, and structural test types are applicable.</p>
          <p>Component integration testing is often the responsibility of developers. System integration testing is generally the responsibility of testers.</p>
          <p>Integration should normally be incremental (i.e., a small number of additional components or systems at a time)</p>
          <p>The greater the scope of integration, the more difficult it becomes to isolate defects to a specific component or system, which may lead to increased risk and additional time for troubleshooting. This is one reason that continuous integration, where software is integrated on a component-by-component basis (i.e., functional integration), has become common practice. </p>
